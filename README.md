# RichWebApplicationLab1
2nd Lab, but the first lab that has to be demoed for the Module: Rich Web Applications.

The extension for problem-3 changes every visible image that is currently on the page to a picture of the Smurf Cat Meme, and changes most of the text on the page to "WE LIVE, WE LOVE, WE LIE".
